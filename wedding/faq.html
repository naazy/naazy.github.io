        <h1>FAQ</h1>

        <h5>1. How do I get to Bush Hall? </h5>
         <p>Well, since you asked, we recommend if taking public transport then go to either Shepherd’s Bush Market on the 
             Hammersmith & City line or Shepherd’s Bush on the Central line.  From either you can walk or take a bus down the Uxbridge Road 
             to the venue taking about 10 / 15 minutes respectively.
         </p>

        <h5>2. What do I wear? </h5>
           <p>There are no rules here! We want this shindig to be relaxing and fun and our main priority here is that you are all happy and comfortable. So feel free to come dressed to the nines in your Saturday best or just wear whatever you feel comfortable in. </p>

        <h5>3. How do I know if I am invited to the ceremony or reception? </h5>
            <p>Check your RSVP email invite that you received from us and this will say in the title and the body which event you are coming to. We would LOVE to feed all of your tummies but unfortunately we don’t have space during the daytime, however, we are just as excited to celebrate with all the people we won’t see at the ceremony in the evening.</p>

        <h5>4. If I arrive early for the reception can I come in? </h5>
        <p> Due to the tight space in the venue as we turn around the place from the ceremony into the dance hall we won’t have any room for any additional people. If in your eagerness you turn up a few minutes, prior, hold tight and we’ll get you in when we can. </p>

        <h5> 5.	Can I bring a plus one?</h5>
        <p> For the ceremony, invites are as stated in the RSVP. For the reception, due to the capacity of the venue, we may be tight on numbers so would prefer to keep invites to what has been stated in the RSVP, however, if you really can’t come on yer Tod drop us a line explaining why and we’ll get back to you.</p>
                
        <h5> 5.	What can I get you for a gift?</h5>
        <p> Your presence is our present :) and there is really no need to get us a gift. However, if you do really want to get us something then a contribution to the honeymoon would be greatly appreciated! Alternatively, we will update this website with a registry link a couple of months before the wedding.
