        <h1>FAQ</h1>

        <h5>1. How do I get to Bush Hall? </h5>
        <p class="light">We recommend if taking public transport then go to either Shepherd’s Bush Market on the
            Hammersmith & City line or Shepherd’s Bush on the Central line. From either you can walk or take a bus down
            the Uxbridge Road
            to the venue taking about 10 / 15 minutes respectively.
        </p>

        <h5>2. What do I wear? </h5>
        <p class="light">There are no rules here! We want this shindig to be relaxing and fun and our main priority here
            is that you are all happy and comfortable. So feel free to come dressed to the nines in your Saturday best
            or just wear whatever you feel comfortable in. </p>

        <h5>3. How do I know if I am invited to the ceremony or reception? </h5>
        <p class="light">Check your RSVP email invite that you received from us and this will say in the title and the
            body which event you are coming to. We would LOVE to feed all of your tummies but unfortunately we don’t
            have space during the daytime, however, we are just as excited to celebrate with all the people we won’t see
            at the ceremony in the evening.</p>

        <h5>4. If I arrive early for the reception can I come in? </h5>
        <p class="light"> Due to the tight space in the venue as we turn around the place from the ceremony into the
            dance hall we won’t have any room for any additional people. If in your eagerness you turn up a few minutes,
            prior, hold tight and we’ll get you in when we can. </p>

        <h5> 5. Can I bring a plus one, child or pet?</h5>
        <p class="light"> We would love to say yes and the more the merrier! However, as numbers are limited, invites
            are as stated in the invite/RSVP email. If you really cannot come on your tod, then drop us a message :)
        </p>

        <h5> 6. What can I get you for a gift?</h5>
        <p class="light"> Please see the <a href="./gifts.html">Gifts page</a>
